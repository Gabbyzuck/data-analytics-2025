Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 correctly sorts comma-separated words, and Challenge 2 finds the longest word in a sentence.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear comments indicating each step of the process.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks, using built-in functions like `split()` and `sort()` which are generally optimized.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external resources or user data handling that would raise security concerns. Input is simply processed and outputted.
