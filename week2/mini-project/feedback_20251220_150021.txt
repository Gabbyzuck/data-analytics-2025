suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic within functions.
- The code could be slightly improved by adding a function to validate player input before processing.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements the Tic Tac Toe game as described in the chapter content. It includes functions for displaying the board, handling player input, checking for a win, and managing the main game loop. All requirements are met.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Function names are descriptive, and the overall logic is clear. The use of comments further enhances readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task. The algorithms used for checking win conditions and ties are reasonable for a 3x3 board.
- security: The code includes basic input validation to ensure that player input is within the allowed range, enhancing security by preventing potential errors or exploits.
