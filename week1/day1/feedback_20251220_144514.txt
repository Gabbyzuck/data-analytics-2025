suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Consider adding comments to further enhance readability, especially for more complex logic.
- The code uses appropriate data structures and algorithms for the given tasks, resulting in good performance.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges. Challenge 1 correctly calculates and outputs a list of multiples, and Challenge 2 effectively removes consecutive duplicate letters from a given string, matching the provided examples and instructions.
- readability: The code is reasonably readable with clear variable names and straightforward logic. However, adding comments could improve clarity.
- performance: The code uses a simple loop and string concatenation, which are efficient for the given input sizes. The performance is adequate for the problem's constraints.
- security: The code uses `input()` function. When using input functions, you should always consider potential security risks, such as malicious inputs. However, for these specific challenges, it seems adequate. Consider input validation in real-world scenarios.
