suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic, especially in Exercise 4 where the loop and list manipulation might not be immediately obvious.
- While the bonus in Exercise 9 correctly filters ages, consider storing the original names or identifiers of the attendees along with their ages, to provide a more useful list of allowed attendees.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are correctly implemented according to the instructions provided in the chapter content. Each exercise addresses the key Python topics outlined and performs the required actions accurately. Specifically:
- Exercise 1: Correctly demonstrates set creation, addition, removal, and union.
- Exercise 2: Accurately explains tuple immutability.
- Exercise 3: Correctly performs list manipulations.
- Exercise 4: Generates the float sequence as described.
- Exercise 5: Uses for loops as requested.
- Exercise 6: Implements the while loop with input validation as expected.
- Exercise 7: Handles user input and list membership correctly.
- Exercise 8: Correctly implements the pizza topping loop and pricing.
- Exercise 9: Calculates total ticket cost and filters attendees for the bonus correctly.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is generally well-commented. Minor improvements could be made by adding more comments to explain potentially confusing logic.
- performance: The code is performant for the given exercises. The use of appropriate data structures (sets, lists, tuples) and efficient methods (e.g., set union, list append) contributes to good performance.
- security: The code is reasonably secure. User input is handled with some basic validation in Exercise 6 to prevent non-string inputs. However, further input sanitization might be necessary in a real-world application to prevent injection attacks.
