Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the requirements outlined in the chapter content, including class definition, constructor, `get_visible_items()`, navigation methods (`go_to_page()`, `first_page()`, `last_page()`, `next_page()`, `previous_page()`), error handling, the `__str__()` method, and the bonus method chaining.  The test cases pass as expected, demonstrating full alignment with the problem description.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of comments to separate sections enhances readability. Minor improvements could involve adding docstrings to each method for better documentation.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task. List slicing and basic arithmetic operations are used, which are generally fast. No major performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external inputs or operations that could pose security risks. The error handling for out-of-range page numbers contributes to robustness.
